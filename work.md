    description:  the development of numerical algorithms and High-Performance Computing (HPC) methods, and their application in solving complex, multi-physics, multi-scale problems arising in science or technology. The implementations of the algorithms take advantage of massively parallel computational architectures. 
  - title: COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS

    description:  I am interested in numerical methods for PDEs. I have developed numerical schemes to improve the accuracy and robustness of existing finite volume methods such as HLLC with MUSCL-Hancock and Flux Limited Centered (FLIC) TVD Schemes. I am also interested in material interface modelling using level-set methods.

    description: I am interested in applying applied maths and computing to resolve phenomena at extreme temperature and pressure conditions.  My recent works involve electromagnetic wave drilling, which has the potential to increase the number of geothermal sites drastically and accelerate progress toward a net-zero energy sector.

    description: I worked on a range of geophysical problems from seismology to oceanography. My most recent work explored seismic coupling in New Zealand where Australian and Pacific plates meet and formed subduction zones, rift valleys and transform faults. The seismic properties are dependent on local lithology and are crucial for determining local earthquake risks.

    description: As the deadliest mass extinction in Earth history, end-Permain eliminated 90% creatures on Earth. The primary cause is the eruption of the Siberian Trap, which triggered a series of climate responses. I am interested in using the geological record to understand the Earth and how to achieve a sustainable future.

Here is a list of projects I have worked on, covering applied mathematics and physics, scientific computing and geophysics. My current projects involve numerical simulation for geothermal energy exploration and statistical methods for stochastic PDEs and its implications to climate modelling and geoscience.
