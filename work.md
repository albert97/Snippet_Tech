    description: I am interested in numerial methods for hyperbolic PDEs. I investigated the techniques of Riemann ghost fluid method in solving the compressible multimaterial unsteady Euler equations. I used MUSCL-Hancock with Super-bee slop limiter and HLLC as the approximate Riemann problem solver. I am also interested in robust methods for material interface modelling such as level set methods.

    description: For Master thesis, I looked into Electromagnetic Wave Drilling which has potential to drastically increase the number of geothermal sites, and accelerate progress toward a net zero energy sector.

    description: New Zealand sits on the boundary between three plates. This unique configuration creates many breathtaking landscape and geophysics features. Seismic coupling is dependent on local lithology, and is crucial for determining local earthquake risks.

    description: As the deadliest mass extinction in Earth history, it eliminated 90% creatures on Earth. The primary cause is the eruption of Siberian Trap. Here we will take a look at the chain reaction from it.

Here is a list of projects I have worked on, covering a wide range of topic. I intend to add link to more detailed work.
