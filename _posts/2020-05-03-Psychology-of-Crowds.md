Given by a friend of mine as a birthday present, it is a very thought-provoking book. Gustave La Bon is 
regarded as the "Father of Crowd Psychology". I would like to share a few quotes I picked up in reading the book  


From another book of Gustave Le Bon -- The crowd: A Study of the popular Mind;

It is crowds rather than isolated individuals that may be induced to run the risk of death to secure the triumph of a creed or an idea, that 
may be fired with enthusiasm for glory and honour... Such heroism is without doubt somewhat unconscious but it is of such heroism that history is made
