Welcome! My name is Albert. I am currently a physics graduate student at the University of Cambridge. My projects focus on developing cheap and reliable renewable energy, notably geothermal and wind. I have a strong interest in carbon capture and storage, I believe a combination of chemical and physical methods will allow us to achieve climate engineering and tackle climate change from its route.

Coming from a mathematics and physics background, I have been dealing with multiphysics, multiphase system under extreme thermodynmic anf fluid dynamics conditions. To tackle the inherited uncertainties in hyperbolic solvers and advance our understanding, I have been working on sharp interface methods which the material/phase interfaces are defined implicitly. Also, to better distribute computational expense, my work often involves structured mesh refinement. Though a group code is available, I often adapt AMReX frame developed by Lawrence National Lab.
